# Project-Woden
This game was first created in a custom Java game engine using Java.awt and Java.Graphics2D I created in 2013, but development was moved to Unity in 2015.

All art and storyline is created by Lee Austen, and I've done all of the coding. This has been a side project for many years now, but is planned to eventually be released through Steam.

This sidescroller platformer has the main masked character fight against a series of ghost like enemies, using magic to defeat them.
The masks augment the abilities and allow power ups.
